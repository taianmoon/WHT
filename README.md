This repository contains data, source catalogues and results of the WHT optical/NIR observations of 5 candidate protoclusters selected by Planck and Herschel. There is a positional offset of Lockman1 field of approximately 1 arcmin, so it is regarded as a field in this study. The directories represent:

[Bootes1, G12, Lockman1, NGP6, NGP7] Maps, source extraction and source catalogues of the five candiate protoclusters. Note that Lockman1 is regarded as field due to the offset.

[Berta_template] The colour-colour plots of the sources overlaid with template SEDs from Berta et al. (2012)

[calibration] Flux density calibration of the sources, using IRAF


All the data, plots and results are the works of the author. Please email the author if you want to use/reproduce any data or plots: taianmoon@gmail.com
